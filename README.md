## Developer Environment Setup
- For version control download [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for preferred OS.
- Download [Unreal Engine 5 and Epic Games Launcher](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download).
- Download IDE for C# development. Preferred is [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/professional/):
	- If using Visual Studio, make sure to install the workloads for:
 		- ASP.NET and web development
   		- Azure development
     	- .NET Multi-platform App UI development
      	- .NET desktop development
      	- Desktop development with C++
      	- WinUI application development
- Download the [.NET8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) SDK. This will be used for running the backend and other dependencies such as the runtime environment.

## Internal Documentation
